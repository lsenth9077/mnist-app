# MNIST-Application
I have created a very simple application that allows users to upload handwritten digits and for my model to predict them. My GitHub is very simple to use organized in different folders. The templates section contains all my pages of my website (HTML). My app.py consists of my Flask program that allows a user to upload and my model to predict a value. I additionally have the uploads section, which saves all the images the user uploads in my application. Finally, I have the static folder, which contains all my CSS files. 

## Packages Needed
- Flask v. 3.1.0
- Numpy and OS
- PyTorch v. 2.0
- Matplotlib v. 3.1.0
- Seaborn (install Python 3.8)
- Scikit Learn v. 1.6.1
- PIL v. 1.1

## Instructions 
Download all the necessary files to your local computer to have access to both the HTML and the Python code. Install Flask by using either a virtual environment or by installing Flask locally on your personal computer, whichever one is easier for you. Afterwards, make sure you install the necessary packages listed above (if you are using a virtual environment, most of them should be preinstalled). To check if the code is working properly, open your terminal and run "python3 app.py".

```terminal
python3 app.py
```
